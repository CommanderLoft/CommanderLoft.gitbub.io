        <h1>The Fried Plaintain Recipe:</h1>
        <h4>But before we get into the recipe, let's talk about the history of the plantain.</h4>
        <p>The plantain actually be traced back to where it orginated from <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, mainly in <strong>Malaysia</strong> and <strong>Indonesia</strong>. From there, the plantain made its way around the world through Asian trading merchants and by Arabic trading merchants during the <u>Trans-Saharan trading boom</u>. Also, at <u><strong>327 B.C.</strong></u>, during <u>Alexander the Great's world conquest</u>, he came into contact with the plantain and brought it back to Europe, where the <u>Portuguese Franciscan Monk</u> introduced it to the <strong>Caribbean Island of Santo Domingo in 1516.</strong></p>
        <p>This recipe is to make <u><em><strong>Fried Plantains;</strong></em></u> it's a pretty basic recipe that doesn't really require a lot of ingredients, but depending on how ripe the plantain is or how thick you slice them can affect how they taste. But it is still basically just the slices of plaintain fried in oil, and it's best served when hot.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plantains (Note the more yellow the plantain is, the sweeter it will be which may or may not be what you're looking for)</li>
            <li>Vegatable oil (There's not really a definitve amount to how much you should use because of pan size and how many plantain slices are in the pan, but you want to just have a thin layer covering the pan)</li>
            <li>Salt (Depends on how much salt you want on the plantains)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you need to peel the plantains before you do anything else. You can do this by cutting off the ends of the plantain and scoring it down the center to eventually peel it open that way.</li>
            <li>Now, slice the plantain chips into slices however thick you want. Just note the thinner the slice, the more crispy and chip like it becomes, while thicker slices are softer.</li>
            <li>Next, grab a pan along with enough oil to make a thin layer spanning the whole pan.</li>
            <li>Now turn the heat on to medium low.</li>
            <li>When the oil starts to shimmer, add the plantain pieces to the oil. Just note that you should only try to put in small batches of plantains, or they might turn out weird because they didn't have the space to properly sit in the oil.</li>
            <li>Now put the heat onto low and cook them for seven minutes on each side. Just make sure they are gold brown when you flip them over.</li>
            <li>Once they are done cooking, use a spatula to remove them from the pan and put them on a paper towel to remove the acess oil.</li>
            <li>At this point, you can salt the plantains for extra flavor.</li>
        </ol>
